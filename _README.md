##### TARGET : MOBILE DEVICES

<sup>1</sup>**Manual zooming is required !**:

> Dear, end-users, once you have the scene painted on your Mobile device screen (_I assume you see some visible shapes there_), make sure you have as-much-as-you-could manually "zoomed-out" screen (<sup>1</sup>**currently you have to do it yourself**), in order to have those shape(s) nicely centred in the middle on your device. In the future this might be fixed programmatically. Thank you for your attention !
